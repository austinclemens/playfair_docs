<h2>Making a simple graph</h2>
<p><b>Very important disclaimer</b>: Playfair is currently only compatible with Chrome.</p>
<p>Again, the hosted version of Playfair is available here: <a href="http://austinclemens.com/Playfair/playfair.html">austinclemens.com/Playfair/playfair.html</a> </p>

<p>Load the data from the first tutorial and make sure you change the DATE column to the date type.</p>

<p>To chart data, select the <span class='tab'>Chart</span> tab from the main navigation bar. Then select the <span class='subtab'>Lines</span> subtab. The various dropdown menus here are already populated with the names of our two columns - DATE and UNRATE. To make a simple line chart of the unemployment rate in the US since 1948, we just select DATE as the x-variable and UNRATE as the y-variable.</p>

<p>Then, below the graph placeholder, click the <span class='button'>Redraw</span> button. Playfair will display this graph:</p>

<p>You can try doing something similar in the <span class='subtab'>Points</span> subtab to see how Playfair's other charting options are similar. Try changing the Connect On dropdown to UNRATE (it is connecting on DATE by default) and hitting the <span class='button'>Redraw</span> button. Line color and line size won't do much with this data set but these will be covered later in the tutorial.</p>

<p>We may want to add some labels to this graph. Click the <span class='tab'>Design</span> tab. The first subtab is <span class='subtab'>Text Elements</span>. Here you can enter a headline, subhead, axis labels, and a note/source for the footer. I'm also going to pop over to the <span class='subtab'>Shading</span> subtab in <span class='tab'>Chart</span> and turn on US recession shading. After clicking <span class='button'>Redraw</span> again, my chart looks like this:</p>

<p>This key doesn't look right, and there are a few other adjustments I want to make, so next we'll look at annotating and adjusting a graph we've made.</p>
