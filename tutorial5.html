<h2>The Settings Tab</h2>
<p><b>Very important disclaimer</b>: Playfair is currently only compatible with Chrome.</p>
<p>Again, the hosted version of Playfair is available here: <a href="http://austinclemens.com/Playfair/playfair.html">austinclemens.com/Playfair/playfair.html</a> </p>

<p>If you really want to extend what you can do with Playfair, you can use the <span class='tab'>Settings</span> tab to adjust the layout and look of your graph. You can really stretch Playfair's limits and do some unusual things here. The graph below, which mimics a graph from Edward Tufte's The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, was created using a number of custom settings.</p>

<p>For example, Playfair has no built in function for removing ticks and tick labels, but you can adjust these parameters in the <span class='subtab'>Grids</span> subtab as shown below:</p>

<p>Some adjustment is also needed to give the graph a large gutter on both the left and right side for text. These parameters can be adjusted in the <span class='subtab'>Graph Area</span> subtab. The background color the chart can be edited here too. I've adjusted it to white here (using the hex color code).</p>

<p>Here's another graph that was created with extensive use of the <span class='tab'>Settings</span> tab:</p>

<p>As with the previous graph, I gave this one a large right margin to accomodate the lengthy annotation I wanted to add. I also adjusted the settings for the point data element to have a thinner border and a larger maximum size, as shown in the screenshot:</p>
